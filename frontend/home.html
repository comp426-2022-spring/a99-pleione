        <p class="introText" id="middle" onclick="showText(this)">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect
            contact with infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Most people with MERS-CoV infection have had severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough,
            and shortness of breath. In total, 27 countries have reported cases since 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="introText" id="covid" onclick="showText(this)">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Common signs and symptoms
            can include Fever, Cough, and Tiredness. So far, 226 countries around the world have reported cases. </p>
        <p class="introText" id="lassa" onclick="showText(this)">Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected Mastomys rats. The onset of the
            disease, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. Lassa
            fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.
        </p>
        <p class="introText" id="hiv" onclick="showText(this)">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system, weakening a person’s immunity against opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis and fungal infections, severe bacterial infections and some cancers.
            Within a few weeks of HIV infection, flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue can occur. Then the disease is usually asymptomatic until it progresses to AIDS. AIDS symptoms include weight loss, fever or night sweats, fatigue,
            and recurrent infections. African remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults living with HIV and accounting for more than two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.
        </p>
        <p class="introText" id="yellow" onclick="showText(this)">Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone mosquito-borne vaccine preventable disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
            The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Central and South Africa.
        </p>
        <p class="introText" id="black" onclick="showText(this)">Black fungus, also known as Mucormycosis, is a serious angio-invasive infection caused by a group of fungi called mucormycetes. Mucormycosis can affect sinuses, lungs, skin, and brain, but it is not a contagious disease, meaning it cannot be spread from one person to another. At least 38 countries worldwide have reported cases of black fungus, about 12,000 cases have been reported in India.
